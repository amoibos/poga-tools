Alternative toolchain for Poga - Portable Game Development Kit Console. The idea came from a removed thread in 4dsystems forum. Goal is a complete free replacement for:

  * compiler (missing)
  * disassembler (one opcode missing, not a part of official tools)
  * runtime (wip, for testing without device)
  * program/firmware uploader(partly works, for firmware needs more work)
