PoGa Dev Kit("PoGa-GOLDELOX")
------------------------------
A construction kit or later assembled Homebrew Gaming Console with pixel display, serial communication and card reader. In year 2012 4dsystems stopped solds. The system uses EVE(Extensible Virtual Engine), a proprietary high performance virtual processor implemented as PmmC(Personality-module-micro-Code). The advantage, the user creates their own code from 4dgl, improvements of EVE come from 4D Systems.

Project Goal
------------
decipher the PoGa platform tools without disassembling of windows executables

Tools and state
-----------
disassembler - to check to output of the compiler
runtime - a simulator equivalent to PmmC
uploader - uploaded your binaries to PoGa

[almost done]
disassembler - handling ret unclear, tests all other opcodes
uploader

[wip]
runtime

[not started]
assembler/compiler
terminal
poga explorer

TODO:
	poga explorer
	check if the limitation hardware based of controlled from software(compiler or pmmc)
	an adequate assembler/compiler
