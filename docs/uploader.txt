Connection establishment
------------------------
required:
	right serial port
	supported connection speed
	timeout(errors in a serial session can causes driver crashes!)
	
    ser.setDTR(True)
    ser.setDTR(False)
    ser.flushInput()
    ser.flushOutput()

device initialisation
---------------------
The initator sends "4dgl"(all strings arent c string), wait some time or repeat it
Device response with "G"
Initator send L<NUMBER OF 64 BYTE BLOCKS TO SEND AS A CHARACTER>, L probably stands for loading
DEVICE answers with <NUL>

transport phase
---------------
every block has a size of 64 bytes and a checksum
last block should fill out
checksum is a character which compute sum of all ascii and flipped
the device response all packets with <NUL>, the last get additionally a <ACK>
